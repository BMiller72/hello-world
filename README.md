# hello-world
A repository for concepts, temp code, etc.
A polished developer looking to alter his career towards web development.
I have been an outperforming Quality Assurance Lead, an outperforming Solutions Analyst or Technical BA, and an outperforming Developer who now wants to learn new languages.
I offer any Company the advantages of strong verbal and written communication, polished knowledge of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), and understand the code logic well enough that I understand each language is simply different syntax.  I am looking for an opportunity to learn that new Syntax with real world requirements.
